Full Stack Role-Based Authentication System with JWT
Project Overview
This is a full-stack web application demonstrating secure, role-based authentication using JSON Web Tokens (JWT). The application implements distinct user roles (USER and ADMIN) to showcase access control and secure API endpoints. The backend is built with Spring Boot and Spring Security, utilizing MySQL as the database, while the frontend is developed using React for a modern and responsive user interface.

The project is designed to highlight my expertise in building secure, scalable, and production-ready applications, with a focus on industry-standard authentication mechanisms and role-based access control (RBAC).

Features
User Authentication: Secure login and registration for users with encrypted passwords using BCrypt.
Role-Based Authorization: Two distinct roles (USER and ADMIN) with restricted access to specific resources and endpoints.
JWT Implementation: Stateless authentication using JWT tokens stored in HTTP-only cookies for enhanced security.
Protected API Endpoints: Role-based access control for API endpoints using Spring Security.
Responsive Frontend: A modern and user-friendly interface built with React, featuring login, registration, and role-specific dashboards.
Database Management: MySQL database to store user data, roles, and other entities, with JPA/Hibernate for ORM.
Error Handling: Comprehensive error handling for invalid credentials, unauthorized access, and expired tokens.
Logout Mechanism: Secure logout by invalidating JWT tokens.
Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS): Configured to allow secure communication between the frontend and backend.

Testing the Application
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:3000.
Register a new user or log in with the following default credentials (for testing):
Admin: admin@example.com / admin123
User: user@example.com / user123
Explore the role-specific dashboards and protected routes.
API Endpoints
Below are the key API endpoints implemented in the backend:

Authentication
POST /api/auth/register - Register a new user
POST /api/auth/login - Login and receive a JWT token
POST /api/auth/logout - Logout and invalidate the JWT token
User Endpoints (Protected)
GET /api/user/profile - Get the authenticated user's profile (Accessible by USER and ADMIN)
GET /api/user/all - Get all users (Accessible by ADMIN only)
Admin Endpoints (Protected)
GET /api/admin/dashboard - Admin dashboard (Accessible by ADMIN only)
Use Postman or any API testing tool to test these endpoints. Ensure to include the JWT token in the Authorization header as Bearer <token> for protected endpoints.

Security Features
Password Encryption: Passwords are hashed using BCrypt before storing in the database.
JWT Security: Tokens are signed with a secret key and have a configurable expiry time.
HTTP-Only Cookies: JWT tokens are stored in HTTP-only cookies to prevent XSS attacks.
CSRF Protection: Enabled via Spring Security to prevent CSRF attacks.
CORS Configuration: Restricted to allow only trusted origins (e.g., the frontend URL).
Future Enhancements
Implement refresh tokens for long-lived sessions.
Add email verification during user registration.
Enhance the frontend with state management using Redux.
Deploy the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Heroku).
Add unit and integration tests using JUnit and Jest.
